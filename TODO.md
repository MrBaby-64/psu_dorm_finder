# Fix Registration Flow

## Steps Completed

1. ✅ Update RegisteredUserController.php to add logging for active DB connection at start of store method.
2. ✅ Run php artisan config:clear to clear cached config.
3. Manually verify .env has correct DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD. (Note: .env file exists but cannot be read; user must check manually.)
4. For testing, manually insert a tenant and landlord user via DB or seeder, check tables have rows with created_at and updated_at set. (Note: Seeder failed due to existing users; user must check DB manually or truncate and re-seed.)
